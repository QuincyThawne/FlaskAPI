      "description": "Ensure that these permissions are required by the application.\n\nandroid.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION (dangerous): coarse (network-based) location - Access coarse location sources, such as the mobile network database, to determine an approximate phone location, where available. Malicious applications can use this to determine approximately where you are.\n\nandroid.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION (dangerous): fine (GPS) location - Access fine location sources, such as the Global Positioning System on the phone, where available. Malicious applications can use this to determine where you are and may consume additional battery power.\n\nandroid.permission.CALL_PHONE (dangerous): directly call phone numbers - Allows the application to call phone numbers without your intervention. Malicious applications may cause unexpected calls on your phone bill. Note that this does not allow the application to call emergency numbers.\n\nandroid.permission.CAMERA (dangerous): take pictures and videos - Allows application to take pictures and videos with the camera. This allows the application to collect images that the camera is seeing at any time.\n\nandroid.permission.GET_TASKS (dangerous): retrieve running applications - Allows application to retrieve information about currently and recently running tasks. May allow malicious applications to discover private information about other applications.\n\nandroid.permission.READ_CALENDAR (dangerous): read calendar events - Allows an application to read all of the calendar events stored on your phone. Malicious applications can use this to send your calendar events to other people.\n\nandroid.permission.READ_CONTACTS (dangerous): read contact data - Allows an application to read all of the contact (address) data stored on your phone. Malicious applications can use this to send your data to other people.\n\nandroid.permission.GET_ACCOUNTS (dangerous): list accounts - Allows access to the list of accounts in the Accounts Service.\n\nandroid.permission.AUTHENTICATE_ACCOUNTS (dangerous): act as an account authenticator - Allows an application to use the account authenticator capabilities of the Account Manager, including creating accounts as well as obtaining and setting their passwords.\n\nandroid.permission.MANAGE_ACCOUNTS (dangerous): manage the accounts list - Allows an application to perform operations like adding and removing accounts and deleting their password.\n\nandroid.permission.READ_PHONE_STATE (dangerous): read phone state and identity - Allows the application to access the phone features of the device. An application with this permission can determine the phone number and serial number of this phone, whether a call is active, the number that call is connected to and so on.\n\nandroid.permission.READ_PHONE_NUMBERS (dangerous): allows reading of the device's phone number(s). - Allows read access to the device's phone number(s). This is a subset of the capabilities granted by READ_PHONE_STATE but is exposed to instant applications.\n\nandroid.permission.READ_PROFILE (dangerous): read the user's personal profile data - Allows an application to read the user's personal profile data.\n\nandroid.permission.RECORD_AUDIO (dangerous): record audio - Allows application to access the audio record path.\n\nandroid.permission.SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW (dangerous): display system-level alerts - Allows an application to show system-alert windows. Malicious applications can take over the entire screen of the phone.\n\nandroid.permission.WRITE_CALENDAR (dangerous): add or modify calendar events and send emails to guests - Allows an application to add or change the events on your calendar, which may send emails to guests. Malicious applications can use this to erase or modify your calendar events or to send emails to guests.\n\nandroid.permission.WRITE_CONTACTS (dangerous): write contact data - Allows an application to modify the contact (address) data stored on your phone. Malicious applications can use this to erase or modify your contact data.\n\nandroid.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE (dangerous): read/modify/delete external storage contents - Allows an application to write to external storage.\n\nandroid.permission.READ_MEDIA_VISUAL_USER_SELECTED (dangerous): allows reading user-selected image or video files from external storage. - Allows an application to read image or video files from external storage that a user has selected via the permission prompt photo picker. Apps can check this permission to verify that a user has decided to use the photo picker, instead of granting access to READ_MEDIA_IMAGES or READ_MEDIA_VIDEO . It does not prevent apps from accessing the standard photo picker manually. This permission should be requested alongside READ_MEDIA_IMAGES and/or READ_MEDIA_VIDEO , depending on which type of media is desired.\n\nandroid.permission.POST_NOTIFICATIONS (dangerous): allows an app to post notifications. - Allows an app to post notifications\n\nandroid.permission.READ_MEDIA_IMAGES (dangerous): allows reading image files from external storage. - Allows an application to read image files from external storage.\n\nandroid.permission.READ_MEDIA_VIDEO (dangerous): allows reading video files from external storage. - Allows an application to read video files from external storage.",
